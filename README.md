# Command_Line_Interpreter
Simulating the Command Line Interpreter of Linux Systems using Java programming languages for some of commands.

An operating system interfaces with a user through a Command Line Interpreter (CLI). A CLI is a software module capable of interpreting textual commands coming either from the userâ€™s keyboard or from a script file. A CLI is often referred to as a shell.

In this Project, I will write a Command Line Interpreter (CLI) for an operating system. My CLI should prompt the user to enter the input through the keyboard. After a sequence of characters is entered followed by a return, the string is parsed and the indicated command(s) executed. The user is then again prompted for another command.

My program implements some built-in commands; the list of required commands is [echo, cd, touch, ls, ls -r, mv, rm, mkdir, rmdir, cat, pwd]. This means that my program must implement these commands directly by using the system calls that implement them.The exit command is also a special case: it should simply cause termination of our program.
